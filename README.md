# phishing-detection-system
This project is performed on a dataset containing benign and phishing URLs. Extensive EDA and pre-processing is performed to improve the insights from the dataset which can be used to improve the overall acuuracy when a deep learning model is run. For now, I have tested only Bi-LSTM which gave a great accuracy and minimal loss.
